# testaro

Ensemble testing for web accessibility

## Introduction

Testaro is an application for automated web accessibility testing.

The purposes of Testaro are to:
- provide programmatic access to accessibility tests defined by several tools
- facilitate the integration of the reports of the tools into a unified report

Testaro is described in two papers:
- [How to run a thousand accessibility tests](https://medium.com/cvs-health-tech-blog/how-to-run-a-thousand-accessibility-tests-63692ad120c3)
- [Testaro: Efficient Ensemble Testing for Web Accessibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10167)

The need for multi-tool integration, and its costs, are discussed in [Accessibility Metatesting: Comparing Nine Testing Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07591).

Testaro launches and controls web browsers, performing operations, conducting tests, and recording results.

Testaro is designed to be a workstation-based agent, because many of the tests performed by Testaro simulate the use of a web browser on a workstation. Testaro can be installed under a MacOS, Windows, Debian, or Ubuntu operating system.

Testaro accepts _jobs_, performs them, and returns _reports_.

Other software, located on any server or on the same workstation, can make use of Testaro, performing functions such as:
- Job preparation
- Converting user specifications into jobs
- Job scheduling
- Monitoring of the health of Testaro
- Management of clusters of workstations sharing workloads
- Allocation of responsibilities among workstations
- Receiving and fulfilling user requests for jobs
- Allocating testing responsibilities to human testers
- Combining reports from workstations and human testers
- Analyzing and summarizing (e.g., computing scores on the basis of) test results
- Sending notifications
- Revising, combining, and publishing reports

One software product that performs some such functions is [Testilo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testilo).

## Dependencies

Testaro uses:
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to launch browsers, perform user actions in them, and perform tests
- [playwright-dompath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-dompath) to retrieve XPaths of elements
- [pixelmatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixelmatch) to measure motion

Testaro performs tests of these _tools_:
- [Accessibility Checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) (IBM)
- [Alfa](https://alfa.siteimprove.com/) (Siteimprove)
- [ASLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@essentialaccessibility/aslint) (eSSENTIAL Accessibility)
- [Axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-playwright) (Deque)
- [Editoria11y](https://github.com/itmaybejj/editoria11y) (Princeton University)
- [HTML CodeSniffer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html_codesniffer) (Squiz Labs)
- [Nu Html Checker](https://github.com/validator/validator) (World Wide Web Consortium)
- [QualWeb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qualweb/core) (University of Lisbon)
- [Testaro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testaro) (CVS Health)
- [WallyAX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wally-ax/wax-dev) (Wally Solutions)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/api/) (WebAIM)

Some of the tests of Testaro are designed to act as approximate alternatives to tests of vulnerable, restricted, or no longer available tools. In all such cases the Testaro rules are independently designed and implemented, without reference to the code of the tests that inspired them.

## Rules

Each tool accessed with Testaro defines _rules_ and tests _targets_ for compliance with its rules. In total, the eleven tools define more than a thousand rules. The latest tabulation of tool rules, excluding those that have been deprecated by Testilo, is:

```
Accessibility Checker: 93
Alfa: 64
ASLint: 129
Axe: 79
Editoria11y: 23
HTML CodeSniffer: 110
Nu Html Checker: 260
QualWeb: 115
Testaro: 46
WallyAX: 27
WAVE: 60
total: 1006
```

Some of the tools are under active development, and their rule counts change over time.

## Code organization

The main directories containing code files are:
- package root: main code files
- `tests`: files containing the code defining particular tests
- `procs`: shared procedures
- `validation`: code and artifacts for the validation of the Testaro tool

## System requirements

Version 16 or later of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Installation

Some of the dependencies of Testaro are published as Github packages. Installing Testaro therefore requires you to be authorized to read Github packages. If you do not yet have that authorization, you can give it to yourself as follows:
- Log in at [Github](https://github.com).
- From your avatar in the upper-right corner, choose “Settings”.
- In the left sidebar, choose “Developer settings”.
- In the left sidebar, choose “Personal access tokens”.
- Activate the button “Generate new token”.
- Give the new token a descriptive note.
- Select an expiration date.
- Check the checkbox `read:packages`.
- Activate the button “Generate token”.
- Copy the generated token (you can use the copy icon next to it).
- In the local directory of the project into which you will install Testaro, create a file named `.npmrc`, unless it already exists.
- Populate the `.npmrc` file with the following statements, replacing `abc` with your Github username and `xyz` with the token that you copied:

    ```bash
    @siteimprove:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
    //npm.pkg.github.com/:username=abc
    //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=xyz
    ```

Once you have done that, you can install Testaro as you would install any `npm` package.

However, if the Playwright dependency is ever updated to a newer version, you must also reinstall its browsers by executing the statement `npx playwright install`.

To run Testaro after installation, provide the environment variables described below under “Environment variables”.

## Payment

All of the tests that Testaro can perform are free of cost, except those performed by the WallyAX and WAVE tools. The owners of those tools issue API keys. A free initial allowance of usage may be granted to you with a new API key. Before using Testaro to perform their tests, get your API keys for [WallyAX](mailto:technology@wallyax.com) and [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/api/). Then use those API keys to define environment variables, as described below under “Environment variables”.

## Jobs

A _job_ is an object that specifies what Testaro is to do. As Testaro performs a job, Testaro reports results by adding data to the job.

### Example

Here is an example of a job:

```javaScript
{
  id: '250110T1200-7f-4',
  what: 'monthly health check',
  strict: true,
  standard: 'also',
  observe: false,
  device: {
    id: 'iPhone 8',
    windowOptions: {
      reducedMotion: 'no-preference',
      userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 11_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/604.1.38 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.4 Mobile/15A372 Safari/604.1',
      viewport: {
        width: 375,
        height: 667
      },
      deviceScaleFactor: 2,
      isMobile: true,
      hasTouch: true,
      defaultBrowserType: 'webkit'
    }
  },
  browserID: 'webkit',
  creationTimeStamp: '241229T0537',
  executionTimeStamp: '250110T1200',
  sendReportTo: 'https://abccorp.com/api/report',
  target: {
    what: 'Real Estate Management',
    url: 'https://abccorp.com/mgmt/realproperty.html'
  },
  sources: {
    script: 'ts99',
    batch: 'departments',
    mergeID: '7f',
    requester: 'malavu@abccorp.com'
  },
  acts: [
    {
      type: 'test',
      launch: {},
      which: 'axe',
      detailLevel: 2,
      rules: ['landmark-complementary-is-top-level'],
      what: 'Axe'
    },
    {
      type: 'test',
      launch: {},
      which: 'qualWeb',
      withNewContent: false,
      rules: ['QW-BP25', 'QW-BP26']
      what: 'QualWeb'
    }
  ]
}
```

This job tells Testaro to perform two acts. One performs one test of the Axe tool wih reporting at detail level 2, and the other performs two tests of the QualWeb tool.

Each act includes a `launch` property with a default value. That instructs Testaro, before performing those tests, to launch a new Webkit browser, open a context (window) with some properties of an iPhone 8 and without a reduced-motion setting, create a page (tab), and navigate to a particular page of the `abccorp.com` website.

Job properties:
- `id`: a string uniquely identifying the job.
- `what`: a description of the job.
- `strict`: `true` or `false`, indicating whether _substantive redirections_ should be treated as failures. These are redirections that do more than add or subtract a final slash.
- `standard`: whether standardized versions of tool reports are to accompany the original versions (`'also'`), replace the original versions (`'only'`), or not be produced (`'no'`).
- `observe`: `true` or `false`, indicating whether tool and Testaro-rule invocations are to be reported to the server as they occur, so that the server can update a waiting client.
- `device`: the ID of a device and the properties of each new browser context (window) that will be set for conformity to that device, unless overridden by an act. It must be `'default'` or the ID of one of [about 125 devices recognized by Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/packages/playwright-core/src/server/deviceDescriptorsSource.json).
- `browserID`: the ID of the browser to be used, unless overridden by an act. It must be `'chromium'`, `'firefox'`, or `'webkit`'.
- `creationTimeStamp`: a string in `yymmddThhMM` format, describing when the job was created.
- `executionTimeStamp`: a string in `yymmddThhMM` format, specifying a date and time before which the job is not to be performed.
- `sendReportTo`: the URL to which the job report is to be sent, or `''` if not a `netWatch` job.
- `target`: data about the target of the job, or `{}` if the job involves multiple targets.
- `sources`: data optionally inserted into the job by the job creator for use by the job creator.
- `acts`: an array of the acts to be performed (documented below).

## Acts

### Introduction

Each act object has a `type` property and optionally has a `name` property (used in branching, described below). It must or may have other properties, depending on the value of `type`.

### Act types

The acts can tell Testaro to perform any of:
- _navigations_ (browser launches, visits to URLs, waits for page conditions, etc.)
- _moves_ (clicks, text inputs, hovers, etc.)
- _alterations_ (changes to the page)
- _tests_ (one or more of the tests defined by a tool)
- _branching_ (continuing from an act other than the next one)

#### Navigations

An example of a **navigation** is:

```json
{
  "type": "wait",
  "which": "travel",
  "what": "title"
}
```

In this case, Testaro waits until the page title contains the string “travel” (case-insensitively).

There is also a `launch` act. You need it in any job before other acts can be performed, unless the acts are all `test` acts and they include `launch` properties, as in the job example above. That `launch` property is a compact alternative to a `launch` act.

#### Moves

An example of a **move** is:

```json
{
  "type": "radio",
  "which": "No",
  "index": 2,
  "what": "No, I am not a smoker"
}
```

In this case, Testaro checks the third radio button whose text includes the string “No” (case-insensitively).

In identifying the target element for a move, Testaro matches the `which` property with the texts of the elements of the applicable type (such as radio buttons). It defines the text of an `input` element as the concatenated texts of its implicit label or explicit labels, if any, plus, for the first input in a `fieldset` element, the text content of the `legend` element of that `fieldset` element. For any other element, Testaro defines the text as the text content of the element.

When the texts of multiple elements of the same type will contain the same `which` value, you can include an `index` property to specify the index of the target element, among all those that will match.

#### Alterations

An example of an **alteration** is:

```json
{
  "type": "reveal",
  "what": "make everything visible"
}
```

This act causes Testaro to alter the `display` and `visibility` style properties of all elements, where necessary, so those properties do not make any element invisible.

#### Branching

An example of a **branching** act is:

```json
{
  "type": "next",
  "if": ["totals.invalid", ">", 0],
  "jump": -4,
  "what": "redo search if any invalid elements"
}
```

This act checks the result of the previous act to determine whether its `result.totals.invalid` property has a positive value. If so, it changes the next act to be performed, specifying the act 4 acts before this one.

A `next` act can use a `next` property instead of a `jump` property. The value of the `next` property is an act name. It tells Testaro to continue performing acts starting with the act having that value as the value of its `name` property.

#### Tests

##### Introduction

An act of type `test` performs the tests of a tool and reports a result. The result may indicate that a page passes or fails requirements. Typically, accessibility tests report successes and failures. But a test in Testaro is defined less restrictively, so it can report any result. As one example, the Testaro `elements` test reports facts about certain elements on a page, without asserting that those facts are successes or failures.

The `which` property of a `test` act identifies a tool, such as `alfa` or `testaro`.

##### Configuration

Every tool invoked by Testaro must have:
- a property in the `tests` object defined in the `run.js` file, where the property name is the ID representing the tool and the value is the name of the tool
- a `.js` file, defining the operation of the tool, in the `tests` directory, whose name base is the name of the tool

The `actSpecs.js` file (described in detail below) contains a specification for any `test` act, namely:

```javascript
test: [
  'Perform a test',
  {
    which: [true, 'string', 'isTest', 'test name'],
    launch: [false, 'object', '', 'if new browser to be launched, properties different from target, browserID, and what of the job'],
    rules: [false, 'array', 'areStrings', 'rule IDs or specifications, if not all']
    what: [false, 'string', 'hasLength', 'comment']
  }
],
```

That means that a test act (i.e. an act with a `type` property having the value `'test'`) must have a string-valued `which` property naming a tool and may optionally have an object-valued `launch` property, an array-valued `rules` property, and/or a string-valued `what` property.

If a particular test act either must have or may have any other properties, those properties are specified in the `tools` property in `actSpecs.js`.

When you include a `rules` property, you limit the tests of the tool that are performed or reported. For some tools (`alfa`, `axe`, `htmlcs`, `qualWeb`, `testaro`, and `wax`), only the specified tests are performed. Other tools (`aslint`, `ed11y`, `ibm`, `nuVal`, and `wave`) do not allow such a limitation, so, for those tools, all tests are performed but results are reported from only the specified tests.

The `nuVal`, `qualWeb`, and `testaro` tools require specific formats for the `rules` property. Those formats are described below in the sections about those tools.

##### Examples

An example of a `test` act is:

```json
{
  "type": "test",
  "which": "wave",
  "reportType": 1,
  "what": "WAVE summary"
}
```

Most tools allow you to decide which of their rules to apply. In effect, this means deciding which of their tests to run, since each test is considered a test of some rule. The act example

```javaScript
{
  type: 'test',
  which: 'alfa',
  what: 'Siteimprove alfa tool',
  rules: ['y', 'r25', 'r71']
}
```

specifies that the tests for rules `r25` and `r71` of the `alfa` tool are to be performed. If the `'y'` in the `rules` array were `'n'` instead, the act would specify that all the tests of the `alfa` tool **except** those for rules `r25` and `r71` are to be run.

One of the tools that allows rule selection, Testaro, has some rules that take additional arguments. As prescribed in `actSpecs.js`, you can pass such additional arguments to the `reporter` functions of those Testaro tests with an `args` property. Example:

```javaScript
{
  type: 'test',
  which: 'testaro',
  what: 'Testaro tool',
  rules: ['y', 'hover', 'focInd'],
  args: {
    hover: [20],
    focInd: [false, 300]
  }
}
```

This act specifies that the Testaro test `hover` is to be performed with the additional argument `20`, and `focInd` is to be performed with the additional arguments `false` and `300`.

##### Expectations

Any `test` act can contain an `expect` property. If it does, the value of that property must be an array of arrays. Each array specifies expectations about the results of the operation of the tool.

For example, a `test` act might have this `expect` property:

```javaScript
'expect': [
  ['standardResult.totals.0', '=', 0],
  ['standardResult.instances.length', '=', 0]
]
```

That would state the expectations that the `standardResult` property of the act will report no rule violations at severity level 0 and no instances of rule violations.

The first item in each array is an identifier of a property of the act. The item has the format of a string with `.` delimiters. Each `.`-delimited segment its the name of the next property in the hierarchy. If the current object is an array, the next segment must be a non-negative integer, representing the index of an element of the array.

If there is only 1 item in an array, it states the expectation that the specified property does not exist. Otherwise, there are 3 items in the array.

The second item in each array, if there are 3 items, is an operator, drawn from:
- `<`: less than
- `=`: equal to
- `>`: greater than
- `!`: unequal to
- `i`: includes
- `e`: equivalent to (parsed identically as JSON)

The third item in each array, if there are 3 items in the array, is the criterion with which the value of the first property is compared.

A typical use for an `expect` property is checking the correctness of a Testaro test. Thus, the validation jobs in the `validation/tests/jobs` directory all contain `test` acts with `expect` properties. See the “Validation” section below.

When a `test` act has an `expect` property, the result for that act has an `expectations` property reporting whether the expectations were satisfied. The value of `expectations` is an array of objects, one object per expectation. Each object includes a `property` property identifying the expectation, and a `passed` property with `true` or `false` value reporting whether the expectation was satisfied. If applicable, it also has other properties identifying what was expected and what was actually reported.

### Tools

The tools whose tests Testaro performs have particularities described below.

#### ASLint

The `aslint` tool makes use of the [`aslint-testaro` fork](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aslint-testaro) of the [`aslint` repository](https://github.com/essentialaccessibility/aslint), which, unlike the published `aslint` package, contains the `aslint.bundle.js` file.

#### HTML CodeSniffer

The `htmlcs` tool makes use of the `htmlcs/HTMLCS.js` file. That file was created, and can be recreated if necessary, as follows:

1. Clone the [HTML CodeSniffer package](https://github.com/squizlabs/HTML_CodeSniffer).
1. Make that package’s directory the active directory.
1. Install the HTML CodeSniffer dependencies by executing `npm install`.
1. Build the HTML CodeSniffer auditor by executing `grunt build`.
1. Copy the `build/HTMLCS.js` and `build/licence.txt` files into the `htmlcs` directory of Testaro.
1. Edit the Testaro copy of `htmlcs/HTMLCS.js` to produce the changes shown below.

The changes in `htmlcs/HTMLCS.js` are:

```diff
479a480
>     '4_1_2_attribute': 'attribute',
6482a6484
>     var messageStrings = new Set();
6496d6497
<         console.log('done');
6499d6499
<         console.log('done');
6500a6501
>       return Array.from(messageStrings);
6531c6532,6534
<       console.log('[HTMLCS] ' + typeName + '|' + msg.code + '|' + nodeName + '|' + elementId + '|' + msg.msg + '|' + html);
---
>       messageStrings.add(
>         typeName + '|' + msg.code + '|' + nodeName + '|' + elementId + '|' + msg.msg + '|' + html
>       );
```

#### Accessibility Checker

The `ibm` tests require the `aceconfig.js` file.

As of 2 March 2023 (version 3.1.45 of `accessibility-checker`), the `ibm` tool threw errors when hosted under the Windows operating system. To prevent these errors, it was possible to edit two files in the `accessibility-checker` package as follows:

In `node_modules/accessibility-checker/lib/ACEngineManager.js`, remove or comment out these lines starting on line 169:

```javaScript
if (nodePath.charAt(0) !== '/') {
    nodePath = "../../" + nodePath;
}
```

In `node_modules/accessibility-checker/lib/reporters/ACReporterJSON.js`, add these lines starting on line 106, immediately before the line `var resultsFileName = pathLib.join(resultDir, results.label + '.json');`:

```javaScript
// Replace the colons in the label with hyphen-minuses.
results.label = results.label.replace(/:/g, '-');
```

These changes were proposed as pull requests 1333 and 1334 (https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/pulls).

The `ibm` tool is one of two tools (`testaro` is the other) with a `withItems` property. If you set `withItems` to `false`, the result includes the counts of “violations” and “recommendations”, but no information about the rules that gave rise to them.

Experimentation indicates that the `ibm` tools emits untrappable errors for some targets when the content argument given to it is the page content rather than the page URL. Therefore, it is safer to use `true` as the value of `withNewContent` for the `ibm` tool.

#### Nu Html Checker

The `nuVal` tool performs the tests of the Nu Html Checker.

Its `rules` argument is **not** an array of rule IDs, but instead is an array of rule _specifications_. A rule specification for `nuVal` is a string with the format `=ruleID` or `~ruleID`. The `=` prefix indicates that the rule ID is invariable. The `~` prefix indicates that the rule ID is variable, in which case the `ruleID` part of the specification is a matching regular expression, rather than the exact text of a message. This `rules` format arises from the fact that `nuVal` generates customized messages and does not accompany them with rule identifiers.

#### QualWeb

The `qualWeb` tool performs the ACT rules, WCAG Techniques, and best-practices tests of QualWeb. Only failures and warnings are included in the report. The EARL report of QualWeb is not generated, because it is equivalent to the report of the ACT rules tests.

QualWeb allows specification of rules for 3 modules: `act-rules`, `wcag-techniques`, and `best-practices`. If you include a `rules` argument in a QualWeb test act, its value must be an array of 1, 2, or 3 strings. Any string in that array is a specification for one of these modules. The string has this format:

```javascript
'mod:m,n,o,p,…'
```

In that format:
- Replace `mod` with `act`, `wcag`, or `best`.
- Replace `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, etc. with the 0 or more integers that identify rules.

For example, `'best:6,11'` would specify that QualWeb is to test for `best-practices` rules `QW-BP6` and `QW-BP11`, but not for any other `best-practices` rules.

When a string contains only a module prefix and no integers, such as `best:`, it specifies that the module is not to be run at all.

When no string pertains to a module, then QualWeb will test for all of the rules in that module.

Thus, when the `rules` argument is omitted, QualWeb will test for all of the rules in all of these modules.

The target can be provided to QualWeb either as an existing page or as a URL. Experience indicates that the results can differ between these methods, with each method reporting some rule violations or some instances that the other method does not report. For at least some cases, more rules are reported violated when an existing page is provided (`withNewItems: false`).

#### Testaro

If you do not specify rules when using the `testaro` tool, Testaro will test for the rules listed in the `evalRules` object of the `tests/testaro.js` file.

The `rules` argument for a `testaro` test act is an array whose first item is either `'y'` or `'n'` and whose remaining items are rule IDs. If `'y'`, then only the specified rules’ tests are performed. If `'n'`, then all the evaluative tests are performed, **except** for the specified rules.

The `testaro` tool (like the `ibm` tool) has a `withItems` property. If you set it to `false`, the `standardResult` object will contain an `instances` property with summaries that identify issues and instance counts. If you set it to `true`, some of the instances will be itemized.

Unlike any other tool, the `testaro` tool requires a `stopOnFail` property, which specifies whether a failure to conform to any rule (i.e. any value of `totals` other than `[0, 0, 0, 0]`) should terminate the execution of tests for the remaining rules.

Warnings in the `testaro/hover.js`, `testaro/motion.js`, and `procs/visChange.js` files advise you to avoid launching particular browser types for the performance of particular Testaro tests.

Several Testaro tests make use of the `init()` function in the `procs/testaro` module. That function samples elements if the population of elements to be tested is larger than 100. The purpose is to achieve reasonable performance. The sampling overweights elements near the beginning of a page, because of the tendency of that location to have important and atypical elements.

You can add custom rules to the rules of any tool. Testaro provides a template, `data/template.js`, for the definition of a rule to be added. Once you have created a copy of the template with revisions, you can move the copy into the `testaro` directory and add an entry for your custom rule to the `evalRules` object in the `tests/testaro.js` file. Then your custom rule will act as a Testaro rule. Some `testaro` rules are simple enough to be fully specified in JSON files. You can use any of those as a template if you want to create a sufficiently simple custom rule, namely a rule whose prohibited elements are all and only the elements matching a CSS selector. More details about rule creation are in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

#### WallyAX

If a `wax` test act is included in the job, an environment variable named `WAX_KEY` must exist, with your WallyAX API key as its value. You can request it from [WallyAX](mailto:technology@wallyax.com).

The `wax` tool imposes a limit on the size of a page to be tested. If the page exceeds the limit, Testaro treats the page as preventing `wax` from performing its tests. The limit is less than 500,000 characters.

#### WAVE

If a `wave` test act is included in the job, the WAVE tests will be performed either by the subscription API or by the stand-alone API.

If you want the subscription API to perform the tests, you must get a WAVE API key from [WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org/api/) and assign it as the value of an environment variable named `WAVE_KEY`. The subscription API does not accept a transmitted document for testing. WAVE must be given only a URL, which it then visits to perform its tests. Therefore, you cannot manipulate a page and then have WAVE test it, or ask WAVE to test a page that cannot be reached directly with a URL.

If you want the stand-alone API to perform the tests, you need to have that API installed and running, and the `wave` test act needs to define the URL of your stand-alone API. The test act can also define a `prescript` script and/or a `postscript` script.

### Browser types

The warning comments in the `testaro/hover.js` and `testaro/motion.js` files state that those tests operate correctly only with the `webkit` browser type. The warning comment in the `testaro/focInd.js` file states that that test operates incorrectly with the `firefox` browser type.

When you want to run some tests of a tool with one browser type and other tests of the same tool with another browser type, you can do so by splitting the rules into two test acts. For example, one test act can specify the rules as

```javascript
['y', 'r15', 'r54']
```

and the other test act can specify the rules as

```javascript
['n', 'r15', 'r54']
```

Together, they get all tests of the tool performed. Before each test act, you can ensure that the latest `launch` act has specified the browser type to be used in that test act.

### `actSpecs` file

#### Introduction

The `actSpecs.js` file contains rules governing acts. The rules determine whether an act is valid.

#### Rule format

The rules in `actSpecs.js` are organized into two objects, `etc` and `tests`. The `etc` object contains rules for acts of all types. The `tools` object contains additional rules that apply to some acts of type `test`, depending on the values of their `which` properties, namely which tools they perform tests of.

Here is an example of an act:

```json
{
  "type": "link",
  "which": "warming",
  "what": "article on climate change"
}
```

And here is the applicable property of the `etc` object in `actSpecs.js`:

```js
link: [
  'Click a link',
  {
    which: [true, 'string', 'hasLength', 'substring of the link text'],
    what: [false, 'string', 'hasLength', 'comment']
  }
]
```

The rule is an array with two elements: a string ('Click a link') describing the act and an object containing requirements for any act of type `link`.

The requirement `which: [true, 'string', 'hasLength', 'substring of the link text']` specifies what is required for the `which` property of a `link`-type act. The requirement is an array.

In most cases, the array has length 4:
- 0. Is the property (here `which`) required (`true` or `false`)? The value `true` here means that every `link`-type act **must** contain a `which` property.
- 1. What format must the property value have (`'string'`, `'array'`, `'boolean'`, `'number'`, or `'object'`)?
- 2. What other validity criterion applies (if any)? (Empty string if none.) The `hasLength` criterion means that the string must be at least 1 character long.
- 3. Description of the property. In this example, the description says that the value of `which` must be a substring of the text content of the link that is to be clicked. Thus, a `link` act tells Testaro to find the first link whose text content has this substring and click it.

The validity criterion named in item 2 may be any of these:
- `'hasLength'`: is not a blank string
- `'isURL`': is a string starting with `http`, `https`, or `file`, then `://`, then ending with 1 or more non-whitespace characters
- `'isBrowserType'`: is `'chromium'`, `'firefox'`, or `'webkit'`
- `'isFocusable'`: is `'a'`, `'button'`, `'input'`, `'select'`, or `'option'`
- `'isState'`: is `'loaded'` or `'idle'`
- `'isTest'`: is the name of a tool
- `'isWaitable'`: is `'url'`, `'title'`, or `'body'`
- `'areStrings'`: is an array of strings

## Reports

### Introduction

Each tool produces a _tool report_ of the results of its tests. Testaro prunes the tool reports for brevity, removing content that is judged unlikely to be useful. Testaro then appends each tool report to the test act that invoked the tool.

Testaro also generates some data about the job and adds those data to the job, in a `jobData` property.

### Contents

A report discloses:
- results of tests conducted by tools
- process data, including statistics on:
    - latency (how long a time each tool takes to run its tests)
    - test prevention (the failure of tools to run on particular targets)
    - logging (browser messaging, including about document errors, during testing)

### Formats

#### Tool-report formats

The tools listed above as dependencies write their tool reports in various formats. They differ in how they organize multiple instances of the same problem, how they classify severity and certainty, how they point to the locations of problems, how they name problems, etc.

A Testaro report can include, for each tool, either or both of these properties:
- `result`: the result in the native tool format.
- `standardResult`: the result in a standard format identical for all tools.

#### Standard result

##### Properties

The standard result includes three properties:
- `prevented`: a boolean (`true` or `false`) value, stating whether the page prevented the tool from performing its tests.
- `totals`: an array of numbers representing how many instances of rule violations at each level of severity the tool reported. There are 4 ordinal severity levels. For example, the array `[3, 0, 14, 10]` would report that there were 3 violations at level 0, 0 at level 1, 14 at level 2, and 10 at level 3.
- `instances`: an array of objects describing the rule violations. An instance can describe a single violation, usually by one element in the page, or can summarize multiple violations of the same rule.

If the value of `prevented` is `true`, the standard result also includes an `error` property describing the reason for the failure.

##### Instances

Here is an example of a standard instance:

```javascript
{
  ruleID: 'rule01',
  what: 'Button type invalid',
  ordinalSeverity: 2,
  count: 1,
  tagName: 'BUTTON'
  id: '',
  location: {
    doc: 'dom',
    type: 'xpath',
    spec: '/html[1]/body[1]/section[3]/div[2]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[1]/button[1]'
  },
  excerpt: '<button type="link"></button>',
  boxID: '12:340:46:50',
  pathID: '/html/body/section[3]/div[2]/div/ul/li[1]/button[1]'
}
```

This instance describes a violation of a rule named `rule01` by a `button` element.

The element has no `id` attribute to distinguish it from other `button` elements, but the tool describes its location. This tool uses an XPath to do that. Tools use various methods for location description, namely:
- `line` (line number in the code of the page): Nu Html Checker
- `selector` (CSS selector): Axe, QualWeb, WAVE
- `xpath`: Alfa, ASLint, Equal Access
- `box` (coordinates, width, and height of the element box): Editoria11y, Testaro
- none: HTML CodeSniffer

The tool also reproduces an excerpt of the element code.

##### Element identification

While the above properties can help you find the offending element, Testaro makes this easier by adding, where practical, two standard element identifiers to each standard instance:
- `boxID`: a compact representation of the x, y, width, and height of the element bounding box, if the element can be identified and is visible.
- `pathID`: the XPath of the element, if the element can be identified.

These standard identifiers can help you determine whether violations reported by different tools belong to the same element or different elements. The `boxID` property can also support the making of images of the violating elements.

Some tools limit the efficacy of the current algorithm for standard identifiers:
- HTML CodeSniffer does not report element locations, and the reported code excerpts exclude all text content.
- Nu Html Checker reports line and column boundaries of element start tags and truncates element text content in reported code excerpts.

Testing can change the pages being tested, and such changes can cause a particular element to change its physical or logical location. In such cases, an element may appear multiple times in a tool report with different `boxID` or `pathID` values, even though it is, for practical purposes, the same element.

##### Standardization configuration

Each job specifies how Testaro is to handle report standardization. A job contains a `standard` property, with one of the following values to determine which results the report will include:
- `'also'`: original and standard.
- `'only'`: standard only.
- `'no'`: original only.

If a tool has the option to be used without itemization and is being so used, the `instances` array may be empty, or may contain one or more summary instances. Summary instances disclose the numbers of instances that they summarize with the `count` property. They typically summarize violations by multiple elements, in which case their `id`, `location`, `excerpt`, `boxID`, and `pathID` properties will have empty values.

##### Standardization opinionation

This standard format reflects some judgments. For example:
- The `ordinalSeverity` property of an instance involves interpretation. Tools may report severity, certainty, priority, or some combination of those. They may use ordinal or metric quantifications. If they quantify ordinally, their scales may have more or fewer than 4 ranks. Testaro coerces each tool’s severity, certainty, and/or priority classification into a 4-rank ordinal classification. This classification is deemed to express the most common pattern among the tools.
- The `tagName` property of an instance may not always be obvious, because in some cases the rule being tested for requires a relationship among more than one element (e.g., “An X element may not have a Y element as its parent”).
- The `ruleID` property of an instance is a matching rule if the tool issues a message but no rule identifier for each instance. The `nuVal` tool does this. In this case, Testaro is classifying the messages into rules.
- The `ruleID` property of an instance may reclassify tool rules. For example, if a tool rule covers multiple situations that are dissimilar, that rule may be split into multiple rules with distinct `ruleID` properties.

You are not dependent on the judgments incorporated into the standard format, because Testaro can give you the original reports from the tools.

The standard format does not express opinions on issue classification. A rule ID identifies something deemed to be an issue by a tool. Useful reporting from multi-tool testing still requires the classification of tool **rules** into **issues**. If tool `A` has `alt-incomplete` as a rule ID and tool `B` has `image_alt_stub` as a rule ID, Testaro does not decide whether those are really the same issue or different issues. That decision belongs to you. The standardization of tool reports by Testaro eliminates some of the drudgery in issue classification, but not any of the judgment required for issue classification.

## Execution

### Introduction

Testaro can be called by modules and by users.

#### Imports

Before a module can execute a Testaro function, it must import that function from the module that exports it. A Testaro module can import function `f` from module `m` with the statement

```javascript
const {f} = require('./m');`
```

The argument of `require` is a path relative to the directory of the module in which this code appears. If the module is in a subdirectory, `./m` will need to be revised. In an executor within `validation/executors`, it must be revised to `../../m`.

A module in another Node.js package that has Testaro as a dependency can execute the same statements, except changing `'./m'` to `'testaro/m'`.

#### Immediate

A job can be immediately executed as follows:

##### By a module

```javascript
const {doJob} = require('./run');
doJob(job)
.then(report => …);
```

Testaro will run the job and return a modified `report` object. When Testaro finishes, the `acts` and `jobData` properties of `report` will contain the results. The final statement can further process the `report` object as desired in the `then` callback.

The Testilo package contains functions that can create jobs from scripts and add scores and explanations to reports.

##### By a user

```bash
node call run
node call run be76p
```

In the second example, `be76p` is the initial characters of the ID of a job saved as a JSON file in the `todo` subdirectory of the `JOBDIR` directory.

The `call` module will find the first job file with a matching name if an argument is given, or the first job file if not. Then the module will execute the `doJob` function of the `run` module on the job, save the report in the `raw` subdirectory of the `REPORTDIR` directory, and archive the job file in the `done` subdirectory of the `JOBDIR` directory.

#### Watch

In watch mode, Testaro periodically checks for a job to run and, when a job is obtained, performs it.

##### Directory watch

Testaro can watch for a job in a directory, with the `dirWatch` function, which can be executed by either a module or a user.

###### By a module

```javaScript
const {dirWatch} = require('./dirWatch');
dirWatch(true, 300);
```

In this example, a module asks Testaro to check a directory for a job every 300 seconds, to perform the jobs in the directory if any are found, and then to continue checking. If the first argument is `false`, Testaro will stop checking after performing 1 job. If it is `true`, Testaro continues checking until the process is stopped.

The directory where Testaro checks for jobs is specified by `JOBDIR`. Testaro checks for jobs in its `todo` subdirectory and, when it has performed a job, moves it into the `done` subdirectory.

Testaro creates a report for each job and saves the report in the directory specified by `REPORTDIR`.

###### By a user

```javaScript
node call dirWatch true 300
```

The arguments and behaviors described above for execution by a module apply here, too.

##### Network watch

Testaro can poll servers for jobs to be performed.

An instance of Testaro is an _agent_ and has an identifier specified by `AGENT`. A Testaro instance identifies itself when polling servers, allowing servers to decide whether to give the instance a job to do.

The URLs polled by Testaro are specified by `JOB_URLS`. The format of that environment variable is a `+`-delimited list of URLs, including schemes. If one of the URLs is `https://testrunner.org/a11ytest/api/job`, and if a Testaro instance has the agent ID `tester3`, then a job request is a `GET` request to `https://testrunner.org/a11ytest/api/job?agent=tester3`.

Once a Testaro instance obtains a network job, Testaro performs it and adds the result data to the job, which then becomes the job report. Testaro sends the report in a `POST` request to the URL specified by the `sendReportTo` property of the job.

Network watching can be repeated or 1-job. One-job watching stops after 1 job has been performed.

After checking all the URLs in succession without getting a job from any of them, Testaro waits for a prescribed time before continuing to check.

###### By a module

```javaScript
const {netWatch} = require('./netWatch');
netWatch(true, 300, true);
```

In this example, a module asks Testaro to check the servers for a job every 300 seconds, to perform any jobs obtained from the servers, and then to continue checking until the process is stopped. If the first argument is `false`, Testaro will stop checking after performing 1 job.

The third argument specifies whether Testaro should be certificate-tolerant. A `true` value makes Testaro accept SSL certificates that fail verification against a list of certificate authorities. This allows testing of `https` targets that, for example, use self-signed certificates. If the third argument is omitted, the default for that argument is implemented. The default is `true`.

###### By a user

```javaScript
node call netWatch true 300 true
```

The arguments and behaviors described above for execution by a module apply here, too. If the first argument is `true`, you can terminate the process by entering `CTRL-c`.

### Environment variables

In addition to their uses described above, environment variables can be used by acts of type `text`, as documented in the `actSpecs.js` file.

Before making Testaro run a job, you can optionally also set `DEBUG` (to `'true'` or anything else) and/or `WAITS` (to a non-negative integer). The effects of these variables are described in the `run.js` file.

You may store environment variables in an untracked `.env` file if you wish, and Testaro will recognize them. Here is a template for a `.env` file:

```conf
WAVE_KEY=yourwavekey
JOB_URLs=https://yourserver.tld/job+http://localhost:3004/testapp
JOBDIR=../testing/jobs/ThisWorkstation
REPORTDIR=../testing/reports
AGENT=ThisWorkstation
DEBUG=false
WAITS=0
```

## Validation

### Validators

Testaro and the tests of the Testaro tool can be validated with the _executors_ located in the `validation/executors` directory.

The executor for a single test is `test`. To execute it for any test `xyz`, call it with the statement `npm test xyz`.

The other executors are:

- `run`: validates immediate test execution
- `watchDir`: validates directory watching
- `watchNet`: validates network watching
- `tests`: validates all the Testaro tests

To execute any executor `xyz` among these, call it with the statement `npm run xyz`.

The `tests` executor makes use of the jobs in the `validation/tests/jobs` directory, and they, in turn, run tests on HTML files in the `validation/tests/targets` directory.

## Contribution

You can define additional Testaro acts and functionality. Contributions are welcome.

Please report any issues, including feature requests, at the [repository](https://github.com/cvs-health/testaro/issues).

## Accessibility principles

The rationales motivating the Testaro-defined tests can be found in comments within the files of those tests, in the `tests` directory. Unavoidably, each test is opinionated. Testaro itself, however, can accommodate other tests representing different opinions. Testaro is intended to be neutral with respect to questions such as the criteria for accessibility, the severities of accessibility defects, whether accessibility is binary or graded, and the distinction between usability and accessibility.

## Testing challenges

### Abnormal termination

On some occasions a test throws an error that cannot be handled with a `try`-`catch` structure. It has been observed, for example, that the `ibm` test does this when the page content, rather than the page URL, is given to `getCompliance()` and the target is `https://globalsolutions.org`, `https://monsido.com`, or `https://www.ambetterhealth.com/`.

Some tools take apparently infinite time to perform their tests on some pages. To handle such stalling, Testaro subjects all tools to time limits. The limitation is implemented with forked child processes. Specifically, the `procs/doTestAct.js` module is run as a forked process with a `timeout` option for each of the 11 tools.

### Activation

Testing to determine what happens when a control or link is activated is straightforward, except in the context of a comprehensive set of tests of a single page. There, activating a control or link can change the page or navigate away from it, interfering with the remaining planned tests of the page.

The Playwright “Receives Events” actionability check does **not** check whether an event is dispatched on an element. It checks only whether a click on the location of the element makes the element the target of that click, rather than some other element occupying the same location.

### Test prevention

Test targets employ mechanisms to prevent scraping, automated form submission, and other automated actions. These mechanisms may interfere with testing. When a test act is prevented by a target, Testaro reports this prevention.

Some targets prohibit the execution of alien scripts unless the client can demonstrate that it is the requester of the page. Failure to provide that evidence results in the script being blocked and an error message being logged, saying “Refused to execute a script because its hash, its nonce, or unsafe-inline does not appear in the script-src directive of the Content Security Policy”. This mechanism affects tools that insert scripts into a target in order to test it. Those tools include `axe`, `aslint`, `ed11y`, and `htmlcs`. To comply with this requirement, Testaro obtains a _nonce_ from the response that serves the target. Then the file that runs the tool adds that nonce to the script as the value of a `nonce` attribute when it inserts its script into the target.

### Tool duplicativity

Tools sometimes do redundant testing, in that two or more tools test for the same defects, although such duplications are not necessarily perfect. This fact creates three problems:
- One cannot be confident in excluding some tests of some tools on the assumption that they perfectly duplicate tests of other tools.
- The Testaro report from a job documents each tool’s results separately, so a single defect may be documented in multiple locations within the report, making the direct consumption of the report inefficient.
- An effort to aggregate the results into a single score may distort the scores by inflating the weights of defects that happen to be discovered by multiple tools.
- It is difficult to identify duplicate instances, in part because, as described above, tools use four different methods for identifying the locations of elements that violate tool rules.

To deal with the above problems, you can:
- configure `test` acts for tools to exclude tests that you consider duplicative
- create derivative reports that organize results by defect types rather than by tool
- take duplication into account when defining scoring rules

Some measures of these kinds are included in the scoring and reporting features of the Testilo package.

### Tool malfunctions

Tools can become faulty. For example, Alfa stopped reporting any rule violations in mid-April 2024 and resumed doing so at the end of April. In some cases, such as this, the tool maker corrects the fault. In others, the tool changes and forces Testaro to change its handling of the tool.

Testaro would become more reliable if the behavior of its tools were monitored for suspect changes.

## Repository exclusions

The files in the `temp` directory are presumed ephemeral and are not tracked by `git`. The above-mentioned `procs/doTestAct.js` module stores temporary reports in that directory.

## Related packages

[Testilo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testilo) is an application that:
- converts lists of targets and lists of issues into jobs
- produces scores and adds them to the raw reports of Testaro
- produces human-oriented HTML digests from scored reports
- produces human-oriented HTML comparisons of the scores of targets

Testilo contains procedures that reorganize report data by issue and by element, rather than tool, and that compensate for duplicative tests when computing scores.

Report standardization could be performed on a server rather than a workstation, but that would require sending the original reports to the server. They are generally much larger than standardized reports. Whenever users want only standardized reports, standardizing them on the workstation eliminates the need to send the original reports anywhere. For that reason, Testaro performs report standardization.

## Code style

The JavaScript code in this project generally conforms to the ESLint configuration file `.eslintrc.json`. However, the `htmlcs/HTMLCS.js` file implements an older version of JavaScript. Its style is regulated by the `htmlcs/.eslintrc.json` file.

## History

Work on the custom tests in this package began in 2017, and work on the multi-package ensemble that Testaro implements began in early 2018. These two aspects were combined into the [Autotest](https://github.com/jrpool/autotest) package in early 2021 and into the more single-purpose packages, Testaro and Testilo, in January 2022.

On 12 February 2024 ownership of the Testaro repository was transfered from the personal account of contributor Jonathan Pool to the organization account `cvs-health` of CVS Health. The MIT license of the repository did not change.

## Contributing

As of 12 February 2024, upon the transfer of the repository ownership to CVS Health, contributors of code to Testaro are required to execute the [CVS Health OSS Project Contributor License Agreement](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=uGG7-v46dU65NKR_eCuM1xbiih2MIwxBuRvO0D_wqVFUQ1k0OE5SVVJWWkY4MTVJMkY3Sk9GM1FHRC4u) for Testaro before any pull request will be approved and merged.

## Etymology

“Testaro” means “collection of tests” in Esperanto.
