      <h1>Page with deviant role elements</h1>
      <section role="section">
        <h2>Abstraction</h2>
        <p>This section has an abstract role, so it is bad.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 role="heading">Redundancy</h2>
        <p>The heading of this section has a redundant role, with an inferred level.</p>
        <section>
          <h3 role="heading" aria-level="3">Redundancy with explicit level</h3>
          <p>The heading of this section has a redundant role because the stated level is 3 and the implicit level is 3.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 role="heading">Failed redundancy for missing level</h3>
          <p>The heading of this section has a heading that fails redundancy because the inferred level is 2 but the explicit level is 3. So the element role is bad.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 role="heading" aria-level="4">Failed redundancy for wrong level</h3>
          <p>The heading of this section has a heading that fails redundancy because the attributional level is 4 but the explicit level is 3. So the element role is bad.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Conflict</h2>
        <p>The parent section of these sections has an unnecessary explicit role <code>main</code>, instead of a <code>main</code> element with the same implicit role.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <h3>Valid redundancy</h3>
        <p>This paragraph contains an input for a number. It has an implicit <code>spinbutton</code> role and the same redundant explicit role. <input type="number" role="spinbutton"></p>
        <h3>Failed redundancy</h3>
        <p>This paragraph contains an input for a number. It has an implicit <code>spinbutton</code> role but an explicit <code>textbox</code> role, so its role is bad. <input type="number" role="textbox"></p>
        <h3>Attribute existence</h3>
        <datalist id="options"><option value="a"></option><option value="b"></option></datalist>
        <p>This input is identical, except that it omits the <code>list</code> attribute. That makes its implicit role <code>textbox</code>, so the explicit role of <code>combobox</code> is bad. <input role="combobox"></p>
      </section>
      <p>Redundant: h2/heading, h3/heading, section/main, input/spinbutton</p>
      <p>Bad: section/section, h3/heading(2), input/textbox, input/combobox</p>
      <p>Redundant order: section/main, h2/heading, h3/heading, input/spinbutton</p>
      <p>Bad order: section/section, h3/heading, input/textbox, input/combobox</p>
      <p>Instance order: section(main, section), h2(heading), h3(heading[3]), input(spinbutton, textbox, combobox)</p>
    </section>
