      <h1>Page with elements having explicit native-replacing roles</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Conflict</h2>
        <p>The parent section of these sections has an unnecessary explicit role <code>main</code>, instead of a <code>main</code> element with the same implicit role. Violation 0.</p>
      </section>
      <section role="section">
        <h2>Abstraction</h2>
        <p>This section has an abstract role, which is invalid, but it does not violate this rule.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 role="heading">Redundancy</h2>
        <p>The heading of this section has a redundant role, with an inferred level. Violation 1.</p>
        <section>
          <h3 role="heading" aria-level="3">Redundancy with explicit level</h3>
          <p>The heading of this section has a redundant role because the stated level is 3 and the implicit level is 3. Violation 2.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 role="heading">Failed redundancy for missing level</h3>
          <p>The heading of this section has a heading that fails redundancy because the inferred level is 2 but the explicit level is 3. It violates this rule regardless of the missing level. Violation 3.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 role="heading" aria-level="4">Failed redundancy for wrong level</h3>
          <p>The heading of this section has a heading that fails redundancy because the attributional level is 4 but the explicit level is 3. So the element role is bad. It violates the rule regardless of the level error. Violation 4.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <h3>Valid redundancy</h3>
        <p>This paragraph contains an input for a number. It has an implicit <code>spinbutton</code> role and the same redundant explicit role. Violation 5. <input type="number" role="spinbutton"></p>
        <h3>Failed redundancy</h3>
        <p>This paragraph contains an input for a number. It has an implicit <code>spinbutton</code> role but an explicit <code>textbox</code> role, so its role is bad. Violation 6. <input type="number" role="textbox"></p>
        <h3>Attribute existence</h3>
        <datalist id="options"><option value="a"></option><option value="b"></option></datalist>
        <p>This input is identical, except that it omits the <code>list</code> attribute. That makes its implicit role <code>textbox</code>, so the explicit role of <code>combobox</code> is bad. Violation 7. <input role="combobox"></p>
      </section>
      <p>8 rule violations, ordinal severity 0</p>
    </section>
