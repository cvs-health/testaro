      <h1>Page with deviant hover behavior</h1>

      <p>Triggers 1 and 2. This page contains a link named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org" onmouseover="document.getElementById('translucent').style.opacity = 1">Trigger 1</a> and a <button type="button" onmouseover="document.getElementById('hiddenP').style.display = 'block'">Trigger 2 button</button>. Both elements can be hovered over.</p>

      <p id="hiddenP" style="display: none">Defect 1: The Trigger 2 button, when hovered over, makes this paragraph, and therefore this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility">link on web accessibility</a> and this <button type="button">new button</button>, visible.</p>

      <p id="translucent" style="opacity: 0.4">The Trigger 1 link, when hovered over, changes the opacity of this paragraph from 0.4 to 1. That indirectly changes the opacity of this <span>word</span>, too. But opacity changes are not covered by the hover test.</p>

      <p>The Trigger 3 button is mostly covered by a Trigger 4 button below, preventing the Trigger 3 button from receiving a hover event. Unhoverability is not covered by the hover test.</p>

      <p style="position: relative"><button id="smallButton" style="position: absolute; left: 10rem">Trigger 3</button><button style="position: absolute; left: 11rem; top: -0.5rem; font-size: x-large">Trigger 4</button></p>

      <p>Defect 2: Hovering over Trigger 5 changes content.</p>

      <ul>
        <li onmouseover="document.getElementById('bottom').setAttribute('hidden', true)">This is a list item, Trigger 5.</li>
        <li>This is another list item, Trigger 6.</li>
      </ul>

      <div id="bottom" style="background-color: #ccc">

        <p>This division becomes invisible when you hover over Trigger 5.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Defect 3:
        <span
          aria-controls="surprise"
          onmouseover="document.getElementById('surprise').style.visibility = 'hidden'"
          style="text-decoration: underline dotted"
        >
          Hover over me
        </span>
        <span id="surprise">and these words disappear.</span>
      </p>
