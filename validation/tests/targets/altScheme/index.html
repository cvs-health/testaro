      <h1>Page with textual and URL text alternatives</h1>
      <p>This is a link to <a href="https://urbaninstitute.github.io/r-at-urban/">a page containing an image</a>.</p>
      <p>Look at this map with a valid text alternative:</p>
      <p><img id="mapGIF" href="https://urbaninstitute.github.io/r-at-urban/mapping/www/images/yay_maps.gif" alt="animated map of the USA"></p>
      <p>Defect 1: Look at this other map:</p>
      <p><img id="mapPNG" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Blank_map_of_states.png" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Blank_map_of_states.png"></p>
      <p>Defect 2: Look at this pattern:</p>
      <p><img href="http://httpforever.com/css/images/header-major-on-light.svg" alt="http://httpforever.com/css/images/header-major-on-light.svg"></p>
      <p>Defect 3: Look at this icon:</p>
      <p><img href="file://favicon.png" alt="file://favicon.png"></p>
      <p>This map has an empty text alternative, but that does not violate the altScheme rule:</p>
      <p><img id="mapGIFBad1" href="https://urbaninstitute.github.io/r-at-urban/mapping/www/images/yay_maps.gif" alt=""></p>
      <p>This map has a text alternative that starts with a URL but continues with other text, so it does not violate the altScheme rule:</p>
      <p><img id="mapGIFBad2" href="https://urbaninstitute.github.io/r-at-urban/mapping/www/images/yay_maps.gif" alt="https://urbaninstitute.github.io/r-at-urban/mapping is a place to get maps from the Urban Institute"></p>
