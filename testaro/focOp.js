  focOp
  Related to Tenon rule 190.

  This test reports Tab-focusable elements that are not operable. The standard practice is to make
  focusable elements operable. If focusable elements are not operable, users are likely to be
  surprised that nothing happens when they try to operate such elements. The test considers an
  element operable if it has a non-inherited pointer cursor and is not a 'LABEL' element, has an
  operable tag name, has an interactive explicit role, or has an 'onclick' attribute. The test
  considers an element Tab-focusable if its tabIndex property has the value 0.
