  opFoc
  Related to Tenon rule 190.

  This test reports operable elements that are not Tab-focusable. The standard practice is to make
  operable elements focusable. If operable elements are not focusable, users who navigate with a
  keyboard are prevented from operating those elements. The test considers an element operable if
  it has a non-inherited pointer cursor and is not a 'LABEL' element, has an operable tag name, has
  an interactive explicit role, or has an 'onclick' attribute. The test considers an element
  Tab-focusable if its tabIndex property has the value 0.
