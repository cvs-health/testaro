  linkUl
  This test reports failures to underline inline links. Underlining and color are the traditional
  style properties that identify links. Lists of links containing only links can be recognized
  without underlines, but other links are difficult or impossible to distinguish visually from
  surrounding text if not underlined. Underlining adjacent links only on hover provides an
  indicator valuable only to mouse users, and even they must traverse the text with a mouse
  merely to discover which passages are links.
