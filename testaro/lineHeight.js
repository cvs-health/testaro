  lineHeight
  Related to Tenon rule 144.
  This test reports elements whose line heights are less than 1.5 times their font sizes. Even
  such elements with no text create accessibility risk, because any text node added to one of
  them would have a substandard line height. Nonetheless, elements with no non-spacing text in
  their subtrees are excluded.
