  motion
  This test reports motion in a page. For minimal accessibility, standards require motion to be
  brief, or else stoppable by the user. But stopping motion can be difficult or impossible, and,
  by the time a user manages to stop motion, the motion may have caused annoyance or harm. For
  superior accessibility, a page contains no motion until and unless the user authorizes it. The
  test compares two screen shots of the viewport 2 seconds and 6 seconds after page load. It
  reports a rule violation if any pixels change. The larger the change fraction, the greater the
  ordinal severity.

  WARNING: This test uses the procs/visChange module. See the warning in that module about browser
  types.
