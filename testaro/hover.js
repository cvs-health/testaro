  hover
  This test reports unexpected impacts of hovering. The elements that are subjected to hovering
  (called “triggers”) include all the elements that have ARIA attributes associated with control
  over the visibility of other elements and all the elements that have onmouseenter or
  onmouseover attributes, as well as a sample of all visible elements in the body. If hovering over
  an element results in an increase or decrease in the total count of visible elements in the body,
  the rule is considered violated.
