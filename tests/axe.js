  axe
  This test implements the axe-core ruleset for accessibility.

  The rules argument defaults to all rules; otherwise, specify an array of rule names.

  The detailLevel argument specifies how many result categories are to be included in the
  details. 0 = none; 1 = violations; 2 = violations and incomplete; 3 = violations, incomplete,
  and passes; 4 = violations, incomplete, passes, and inapplicable. Regardless of the value of this
  argument, Axe-core is instructed to report all nodes with violation or incomplete results, but only
  1 node per rule found to be passed or inapplicable. Therefore, from the results of this test it
  is possible to count the rules passed and the inapplicable rules, but not the nodes for which each
  rule is passed or inapplicable. To count those nodes, one would need to revise the 'resultTypes'
  property of the 'axeOptions' object.

  The report of this test shows rule totals by result category and, within the violation and
  incomplete categories, node totals by severity. It does not show rule or node totals by test
  category (“tag”), such as 'wcag21aaa'. Scoring can consider test categories by getting the value
  of the 'tags' property of each rule.
